         'android' tool to add properties to it.
         This is the place to change some Ant specific build properties.
         Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

         source.dir
             The name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
         out.dir
             The name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.

         For other overridable properties, look at the beginning of the rules
         files in the SDK, at tools/ant/build.xml

         Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should
         be updated using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

         This file is an integral part of the build system for your
         application and should be checked into Version Control Systems.

         This contains project specific properties such as project target, and library
         dependencies. Lower level build properties are stored in ant.properties
         (or in .classpath for Eclipse projects).

     To customize existing targets, there are two options:
     - Customize only one target:
     - copy/paste the target into this file, *before* the
     <import> task.
     - customize it to your needs.
     - Customize the whole content of build.xml
     - copy/paste the content of the rules files (minus the top node)
     into this file, replacing the <import> task.
     - customize to your needs.
